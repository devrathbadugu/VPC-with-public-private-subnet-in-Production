# VPC-with-public-private-subnet-in-Production
This project showcases the creation of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for production servers, enhancing resiliency by deploying servers across two Availability Zones using an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer. Servers are housed in private subnets, accessing the internet through a NAT gateway in each zone.
